# 🚀 EV Charging Infrastructure vs. Adoption Rates – Data-Driven Insights
## 📌 Overview

This project investigates whether EV charging infrastructure is keeping pace with the rising adoption of electric vehicles in the U.S. Using data-driven insights and statistical analysis, we assess infrastructure growth, forecast trends, and identify potential gaps that could impact EV adoption.

With the global push towards sustainability and clean energy, understanding how infrastructure development aligns with market adoption is crucial for policymakers, businesses, and consumers.
## 📊 Key Highlights

- Real-World Data Analysis – Utilized datasets from the U.S. Department of Energy and Statzon to track EV registrations and charging station growth.
- Predictive Modeling – Employed linear regression to forecast EV adoption and infrastructure expansion up to 2027.
- Data-Driven Decision Making – Identified disparities in charging infrastructure across states and their impact on EV adoption rates.
- Interactive Visualizations – Created compelling Tableau and Power BI dashboards to communicate key findings.

## Research Findings

- EV registrations are skyrocketing – Sales surged 238% from 2020 to 2023, but charging infrastructure growth is not keeping up.
- Charging station-to-EV ratio is declining, highlighting an urgent need for more charging stations.
- California leads in EV adoption but also has the most significant infrastructure gap.
- Tesla dominates the EV market, influencing charging network development and availability.

## 🔍 Data & Methodology
### 📂 Datasets

- EV Charging Stations – Location and availability data from the U.S. Department of Energy.
- EV Registrations by State – Annual EV adoption trends from 2018–2022.
- EV Sales by Brand – Sales figures for major automakers in 2022–2023.

### ⚙️ Tools & Techniques

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) – Data cleaning, correlation analysis, forecasting.
- Tableau & Power BI – Visualization dashboards and interactive insights.
- Hypothesis Testing – Examined the correlation between charging infrastructure density and EV adoption rates.
- Linear Regression Forecasting – Predicted future trends for EV registrations and charging infrastructure growth.

## 🔮 Future Implications

- 🚗 If infrastructure gaps persist, charging bottlenecks may hinder EV adoption and delay the transition to sustainable transportation.
- 📌 Our research highlights the need for strategic investments in charging stations, particularly in high-adoption states like California.

## 📢 Business & Policy Recommendations
- Prioritize charging infrastructure investments to match rising EV demand.
- Expand fast-charging networks to address range anxiety and wait times.
- Develop state-specific policies to address regional disparities in EV adoption.

## 🏆 Why This Project Stands Out

- Real-world impact – Addresses a critical challenge in the EV industry.
- Data-driven insights – Not just opinions, but actionable findings backed by data.
- Engaging visual storytelling – Interactive dashboards that make insights accessible to all stakeholders.

## Tableau Dashboard
The dashboard provides a multi-view of the EV landscape, revealing a significant increase in the number of charging stations and illustrating a positive correlation between station availability and EV adoption. Despite this growth, the expanding gap in the ideal number of charging stations per EV indicates that infrastructure is not scaling at the necessary rate. Furthermore, the actual to ideal charging station ratio by state and the dominance of Tesla in sales and market share underscore the uneven distribution of both EVs and the supporting infrastructure. California's particularly high EV to charging station ratio indicates regional disparities that could impede the broader adoption of EVs. Collectively, the dashboard highlights the importance of strategic investment and planning in charging infrastructure that not only keeps pace with, but anticipates, future EV adoption rates.
